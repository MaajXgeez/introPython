1. A variable is a container or placeholder in a computer program that is used to store and manage data. It allows you to assign a name to a piece of data, such as a number, text, or more complex information, making it easier to reference and manipulate within the program. Variables provide a way to store and access values so that you can perform operations on them, compare them, or use them in various parts of your code. In essence, variables serve as a means of organizing and working with data in a program.



2. Certainly! Here are three types of operators along with situations where you would use them:

Arithmetic Operators (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication):

Addition (+): You would use the addition operator when you need to calculate the total of items, such as adding prices of products in a shopping cart.
Subtraction (-): Subtraction is handy when you want to find the difference between two values, like calculating change after a purchase.
Multiplication (*): Multiplication can be used for various scenarios, such as calculating the total cost of multiple items at a specific price per item.
Logical Operators (e.g., AND, OR, NOT):

AND (&&): You might use the logical AND operator when dealing with conditions that require multiple criteria to be true simultaneously. For example, checking if both a user's username and password are correct before allowing access to a system.
OR (||): OR is useful when you want to check if at least one of multiple conditions is true. For instance, granting access if a user has either a valid username or email.
NOT (!): The logical NOT operator can be used to reverse the truth value of a condition. For instance, checking if a user is NOT an administrator to restrict certain actions.
Comparison Operators (e.g., equal to, greater than, less than):

Equal To (==): You would use the equal to operator to compare if two values are equal. For example, checking if a user's input matches a predefined value, like confirming if the entered number is equal to 10.
Greater Than (>): Greater than is used to compare if one value is larger than another. For instance, checking if a user's age is greater than 18 to determine if they can access age-restricted content.
Less Than (<): Less than is useful for comparing if one value is smaller than another, such as checking if a product's price is less than a certain threshold to apply a discount.
These operators are fundamental in programming and are used extensively to perform various tasks, including calculations, decision-making, and data manipulation.

3. 
You've got the basic idea, but let's clarify:

Camel Case:

In camel case, the first letter of the identifier is in lowercase, and the first letter of each subsequent concatenated word is capitalized.
Example: nameOfClass (first letter lowercase, "o" and "C" are capitalized).
Pascal Case:

de   In Pascal case, the first letter of each word in the identifier is capitalized, including the first word.
Example: NameOfClass (first letter and "O" and "C" are capitalized).
Both camel case and Pascal case are commonly used naming conventions in programming, and they help improve code readability by providing a consistent way to name variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers. The choice between them often depends on the coding style guidelines of a particular programming language or project.


5. moneyFromFamOne = 100.00
moneyFromFamTwo = 50.00
moneyFromFriend = 35.50

# Calculate the total amount of money on the gift card directly
totalAmountOfMoney = 100.00 + 50.00 + 35.50
print("Total Amount of Money (Direct Calculation): $" + str(totalAmountOfMoney))

# Calculate the total amount of money on the gift card using variables
totalAmountOfMoneyVariables = moneyFromFamOne + moneyFromFamTwo + moneyFromFriend
print("Total Amount of Money (Using Variables): $" + str(totalAmountOfMoneyVariables))


6. name = input("What is your name? ")
print(name)

7. # Capture visitor's information
name = input("What is your full name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
allergy = input("Do you have any allergies? ")
favoriteFood = input("What is your favorite food? ")

# Print out the captured information
print("Visitor's Information:")
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Allergies:", allergy)
print("Favorite Food:", favoriteFood)


8. hasGlutenAllergy = True  # If the user has a gluten allergy
# OR
hasGlutenAllergy = False  # If the user does not have a gluten allergy

9. A program is a set of instructions or a sequence of coded commands that are designed to perform a specific task or
 solve a particular problem when executed by a computer or computing device. These instructions can encompass various actions
 , calculations, and logical operations, allowing the computer to process data, make decisions, and produce desired results. 
 In essence, a program serves as a tool for providing step-by-step guidance to a computer, enabling it to carry out a defined
   and often complex set of actions to achieve a specific goal or purpose.


10. Float (Floating-Point Number):

A float is a data type that represents real numbers, including numbers with decimal points.
Floats can represent both whole numbers and numbers with fractional parts.
Example of a float: 3.14, 0.5, -2.0.
Integer:

An integer is a data type that represents whole numbers, which means numbers without any fractional or decimal part.
Integers do not include decimal points or fractions; they are whole numbers.
Example of an integer: 5, -10, 0.
In summary, the primary difference is that a float can have decimal or fractional parts, while an integer represents whole 
numbers with no decimal parts. Floats are used when you need to work with real numbers, including those with decimal places,
 whereas integers are used for operations involving whole numbers.
